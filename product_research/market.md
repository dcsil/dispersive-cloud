## Market Opportunity

Dispersive Cloud is currently in the security information and event management industry, SIEM for short. The SIEM industry mainly focuses on developing technology to support threat detection. It also uses historical and real-time data to analyse and identify incidents and events. Most importantly, it provides organised reports of all security-related events and incidents such as failed login, unusual activity, etc. It then uses those reports to send out alerts to indicate potential security issues. The SIEM market size is around 2.4 billion (Frost & Sullivan, 2019), with the small businesses(less than 10,000 employees) taking around 48.1% of the market and cloud services with around 90%. Thus, our market share is around 1.03 billion(2.4 billion * 48.1% *90%).

## Market Landscape

Dispersive Cloud has several competitors in different areas, including Biocatch, McAfee, and Splunk. Biocatch is related to Microsoft Cloud services which function as a solution provider to possible problems in the area of biometrics. McAfee provides its services in terms of a firewall for data security in both environments of local and cloud data. Splunk generally includes service in both areas of biometrics and cloud data security. Although they are undoubtedly significant competitors to us, we have our unique use of mouse tracking methodology, which is not provided by any of these companies, can fulfil specific needs such as low-cost accessibility for individuals and privacy protection from leaving personal data out of our servers, which our competitors often neglect.
